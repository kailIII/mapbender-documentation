Coordinate Utility
******************

The element *Coordinate Utility* allows two different things:

1. Zoom to a given Point-coordinate
2. Show the click-point of the map.

Both functions can be accessed with one dialog.

Both cases allow a dynamic coordinate-transofrmation so that also points in a different coordinate-system can be used.

Additional you have the possibility to copy the coordinates into the clipboard.

The element can be configured in the Mapbender-Backend as a dialog with a button or directly in the Sidebar as an element.


Initialization and Configuration
================================

Add the element `Coordinate Utility` into the content of your application.

The customization allows - besides the standard-configuration - some additional options:

     :scale: 80

* Title: Title of the element.
* Target: Map on which this tool works (Main Map)
* Type: Dialog or Element.
  
  * Dialog: The tool is placed in the Content of the application and is called with a button. The tool is presented as a dialog.
  * Element: The tool is placed in the Sidebar of the application. You have to declare it as element.

 * Srs List: You can define additional SRS to which the tool has to transform the coordinates. This list can be left empty.

 * Add map's srs list: The supported coordinate-systems defined in the `Map element  <../elements/map.html>`_ are automatically used by the Coordinate-Tool. These coordinate systems, defined in the map, are also used by the `SRS Selector  <../elements/srs_selector.html>`_.

If you define the Tool as a dialog, you need a `Button  <../elements/button.html>`_ that you place in the Toolbar. The following screenshot shows an example configuration of the button:

* Target: Name of the tool that is placed in the content of the application (Koordinaten Utility)


Using the tool
===============

**Get Coordinate:**

If the Coordinate tool is opened as a dialog, the map reacts on a click. Click into the map and the click-coordinate is displayed in the dialog.

Change the coordinate system with the drop-down-list. The click-coordinate is displayed in the given coordinate-system.

The last line therefore shows the click-coordinate in the original coordinate-system of the map.

The button at the end of each text-field allows to copy the coordinate directly into the clipboard.


**Zoom to coordinate:**

The text-field can be used to edit your own coordinates. They must be given in the coordinate-system that is chosen in the upper drop-down list. With a click on the **Center map** button, the map zooms to the given coordinate and shows the position with an orange symbol.
